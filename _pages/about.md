I’m a PhD student at the [Università della Svizzera italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch/en) in Lugano, where I work primarily on compilers for hardware accelerators and, more recently, on logic synthesis. 

My research focuses on scalable and high-quality compilation and optimization techniques for these domains, with particular attention to mapping problems, structural representations of computation, and building tools that scale well without sacrificing performance. 

I try to  combines formal methods, algorithm design, and low-level hardware reasoning to make specialized architectures more programmable and efficient. Beyond that, I’m also interested in optimization problems, high-performance computing, and security.
