I’m a PhD student at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Lugano (Switzerland), where I work primarily on compilers for hardware accelerators and, more recently, on logic synthesis. 

My research focuses on developing scalable and high-quality compilation and optimization techniques for these domains. I was awarded a PhD Mobility grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and spent a research period of 8 months at UCLA. 

I’m also interested in optimization problems, high-performance computing, and security.
